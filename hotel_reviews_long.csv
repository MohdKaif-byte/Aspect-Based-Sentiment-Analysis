1,"My stay at this hotel was generally okay. The room was clean, but very basic and a bit outdated. The staff were polite but not particularly engaging. I appreciated the central location, but overall, nothing stood out as exceptional or memorable. A decent place if you're just looking for a place to sleep.",neutral
2,"It was a standard experience—neither great nor terrible. The bed was comfortable enough, and the location was convenient. I didn’t interact much with the staff, but check-in and check-out were straightforward. Would consider staying again for a short visit, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",neutral
3,"I had an incredible stay at the hotel. From the moment I arrived, the staff greeted me warmly and offered complimentary drinks. The room was not only spacious and modern but also immaculately clean. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the view from the balcony was breathtaking. Breakfast offered a wide variety of delicious options. I would definitely return!",positive

The breakfast buffet was cold and lacked variety. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel.",negative
